# eh_Utilities

Godot Plugin with basic helpers and common scripts / custom resources / custom classes I reuse across projects and even across addons.

Feel free to use them in your projects, I'm trying to document how to use them in their comments, and eventually setup a wiki/docs site for them, but meanwhile, if anything is confusing or undocumented fell free to get in touch or open an issue and I'll be happy to explain.
